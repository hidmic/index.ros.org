<p>ROS Index aims to be the <em>definitive index</em> of all ROS software. It aims to do this
not only by indexing all known ROS packages listed in
<a href="http://github.com/ros/rosdistro">rosdistro</a>, but also include relevant forks
of known ROS packages, and encourage people to get their packages added to the
index <em>no matter how volatile or buggy they are</em>.</p>

<p>ROS Index also aims to better summarize the pulse of the ROS development
community with <a href="/stats/">statistics</a> and the ability to list the <a href="/packages/page/1/time/">most recently
updated ROS repositories</a>.</p>

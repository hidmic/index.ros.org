## Troubleshooting

### Enable Multicast
In order to communicate successfully via DDS, the used network interface has to be multicast enabled.
We've seen in past experiences that this might not necessarily be enabled by default (on Ubuntu or OSX) when using the loopback adapter.
See the [original issue](https://github.com/ros2/ros2/issues/552) or a [conversation on ros-answers](https://answers.ros.org/question/300370/ros2-talker-cannot-communicate-with-listener/).
You can verify that your current setup allows multicast with the ROS 2 tool:

In Terminal 1:
```
ros2 multicast receive
```
In Terminal 2:
```
ros2 multicast send
```

<p>This is a merged version of the previously separated pages for the 8 alpha releases of ROS 2.</p>

<h2 id="ros-2-alpha8-release-code-name-hook-and-loop-october-2016">ROS 2 alpha8 release (code name <em>Hook-and-Loop</em>; October 2016)</h2>

<p>Welcome to the latest release of ROS 2 software!  We hope that you try it out and <a href="#contact-us">provide feedback</a>.</p>

<h3 id="changes-to-supported-dds-vendors">Changes to supported DDS vendors</h3>

<p>ROS 2 supports multiple middleware implementations (see <a href="/index.ros.org/doc/ros2_overview/DDS-and-ROS-middleware-implementations.html">this page</a> for more details).
Until Alpha 8, ROS 2 was supporting ROS middleware implementations for eProsima&#39;s Fast RTPS, RTI&#39;s Connext and PrismTech&#39;s OpenSplice.
To streamline our efforts, as of Alpha 8, Fast RTPS and Connext (static) will be supported, with Fast RTPS (<a href="http://www.eprosima.com/index.php/company-all/news/61-eprosima-goes-apache">now Apache 2.0-licensed</a>) shipped as the default.</p>

<h3 id="scope">Scope</h3>

<p>As the &quot;alpha&quot; qualifier suggests, this release of ROS 2 is far from complete.
You should not expect to switch from ROS 1 to ROS 2, nor should you expect to build a new robot control system with ROS 2.
Rather, you should expect to try out some demos, explore the code, and perhaps write your own demos.</p>

<p>The improvements included in this release are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Several improvements to Fast RTPS and its rmw implementation

<ul>
<li>Support for large (image) messages in Fast RTPS</li>
<li><code>wait_for_service</code> functionality in Fast RTPS</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Support for all ROS 2 message types in Python and C</li>
<li>Added support for Quality of Service (QoS) settings in Python</li>
<li>Fixed various bugs with the previous alpha release</li>
</ul>

<p>Pretty much anything not listed above is not included in this release.
The next steps are described in the <a href="/index.ros.org/doc/ros2_overview/Roadmap.html">Roadmap</a>.</p>

<h2 id="ros-2-alpha7-release-code-name-glue-gun-july-2016">ROS 2 alpha7 release (code name <em>Glue Gun</em>; July 2016)</h2>

<p>Welcome to the latest release of ROS 2 software!  We hope that you try it out and <a href="#contact-us">provide feedback</a>.</p>

<h3 id="new-version-of-ubuntu-required">New version of Ubuntu required</h3>

<p>Until Alpha 6 ROS 2 was targeting Ubuntu Trusty Tahr (14.04). As of this Alpha ROS 2 is targeting Ubuntu Xenial Xerus (16.04) to benefit from newer versions of the compiler, CMake, Python, etc.</p>

<h3 id="scope">Scope</h3>

<p>As the &quot;alpha&quot; qualifier suggests, this release of ROS 2 is far from complete.
You should not expect to switch from ROS 1 to ROS 2, nor should you expect to build a new robot control system with ROS 2.

<p>The major features included in this release are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Graph API functionality: wait_for_service

<ul>
<li>Added interfaces in rclcpp and make use of them in examples, demos, and tests</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Improved support for large messages in both Connext and Fast-RTPS (partial for Fast-RTPS)</li>
<li>Turtlebot demo using ported code from ROS 1

<ul>
<li>See: <a href="https://github.com/ros2/turtlebot2_demo">https://github.com/ros2/turtlebot2_demo</a></li>

<h3 id="background">Background</h3>

<p>As explained in a <a href="http://design.ros2.org/articles/why_ros2.html">design
article</a>, we are engaged in
the development of a new major version of ROS, called &quot;ROS 2.&quot; While the
underlying concepts (e.g., publish / subscribe messaging) and goals (e.g.,
flexibility and reusability) are the same as for ROS 1, we are taking this
opportunity to make substantial changes to the system, including changing
some of the core APIs.
For a deeper treatment of those changes and their
rationale, consult the other <a href="http://design.ros2.org">ROS 2 design
articles</a>.</p>

<h3 id="status">Status</h3>

<p>On February 17, 2016, we are releasing ROS 2 alpha4,
code-named <strong>Duct tape</strong>.
Our primary goal with this release is to add more features, while also addressing the feedback we received for the previous releases.
To that end, we built a set of <a href="Tutorials">demos</a> that
show some of the key features of ROS 2.
We encourage you to try out those
demos, look at the code that implements them, and <a href="#contact-us">provide
feedback</a>.
We&#39;re especially interested to know how well (or
poorly) we&#39;re addressing use cases that are important to you.</p>

<h3 id="intended-audience">Intended audience</h3>

<p>While everyone is welcome to try out the demos and look through the code, we&#39;re aiming this release at people who are already experienced with ROS 1 development.
At this point, the ROS 2 documentation is pretty sparse and much of the system is explained by way of how it compares to ROS 1.</p>

Rather, you

your own demos.</p>

<p>The major features included in this release are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Improved type support infrastructure, including support for C</li>
<li>Preliminary Python client library, only publishers and subscriptions are supported. Beware, the API is subject to change and is far from complete!</li>
<li>Added structures for ROS time in C API (still needs C++ API)

<ul>
<li>New concept of extensible &quot;time sources&quot; for ROS Time, the default time source will be like ROS 1 (implementation pending)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

At this point, the ROS 2 documentation is pretty sparse and much of the system is explained by way of how it compares to ROS 1.</p>

<h3 id="scope">Scope</h3>

<p>As the &quot;alpha&quot; qualifier suggests, this release of ROS 2 is far from
complete.
You should not expect to switch from ROS 1 to ROS 2, nor should
you expect to build a new robot control system with ROS 2.
Rather, you
should expect to try out some demos, explore the code, and perhaps write
your own demos.</p>

<p>The major features included in this release are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Updated <code>rcl</code> interface.

<ul>
<li>This interface will be wrapped in order to create language bindings, e.g. <code>rclpy</code>.</li>
<li>This interface has improved documentation and test coverage over existing interfaces we currently have, e.g. <code>rmw</code> and <code>rclcpp</code>.</li>
<li>See: <a href="https://github.com/ros2/rcl/tree/release-alpha3/rcl/include/rcl">https://github.com/ros2/rcl/tree/release-alpha3/rcl/include/rcl</a></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Added support in rclcpp for using the TLSF (two-level segregate fit) allocator, a memory allocator design for embedded and real-time systems.</li>
<li>Improved efficiency of MultiThreadedExecutor and fixed numerous bugs with multi-threaded execution, which is now test on CI.</li>
<li>Added ability to cancel an Executor from within a callback called in spin.</li>
<li>Added ability for a timer to cancel itself by supporting a Timer callback that accepts a reference to itself as a function parameter.</li>
<li>Added checks for disallowing multiple threads to enter Executor::spin.</li>
<li>Improved reliability of numerous tests that had been sporadically failing.</li>
<li>Added support for using FastRTPS (instead of, e.g., OpenSplice or Connext).</li>
<li>A partial port of tf2 including the core libraries and core command line tools. </li>
</ul>

<p>Pretty much anything not listed above is not included in this release.
The next steps are described in the <a href="/index.ros.org/doc/ros2_overview/Roadmap.html">Roadmap</a>.</p>

<h3 id="background">Background</h3>

<p>As explained in a <a href="http://design.ros2.org/articles/why_ros2.html">design
article</a>, we are engaged in
the development of a new major version of ROS, called &quot;ROS 2.&quot; While the
underlying concepts (e.g., publish / subscribe messaging) and goals (e.g.,
flexibility and reusability) are the same as for ROS 1, we are taking this
opportunity to make substantial changes to the system, including changing
some of the core APIs.
For a deeper treatment of those changes and their
rationale, consult the other <a href="http://design.ros2.org">ROS 2 design
articles</a>.</p>

<h3 id="status">Status</h3>

<p>On November 3, 2015, we are releasing ROS 2 alpha2,
code-named <strong>Baling wire</strong>.
Our primary goal with this release is to add more features, while also addressing the feedback we received for the previous alpha 1 release.
To that end, we built a set of <a href="Tutorials">demos</a> that
show some of the key features of ROS 2.
We encourage you to try out those
demos, look at the code that implements them, and <a href="#contact-us">provide
feedback</a>.
We&#39;re especially interested to know how well (or
poorly) we&#39;re addressing use cases that are important to you.</p>

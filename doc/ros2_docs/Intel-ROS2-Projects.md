# Intel ROS2 Projects
Intel® Robotics Open Source Project (Intel® ROS Project) to enable the object detection, 2D location, 3D location and tracking with GPU or [Intel® Movidius™ NCS](https://developer.movidius.com/) optimized deep learning backend, and [Intel® RealSense™](http://www.intel.com/realsense) camera under ROS2 framework.

## Key Projects
We will work on below ROS2 projects and publish source code at https://github.com/intel/ gradually.
*  [ROS2 RealSense Camera](https://github.com/intel/ros2_intel_realsense): ROS2 package for Intel® RealSense™ D400 serial cameras
*  [ROS2 Movidius NCS](https://github.com/intel/ros2_intel_movidius_ncs): ROS2 package for object detection with Intel® Movidius™ Neural Computing Stick (NCS).
*  [ROS2 Object Messages](https://github.com/intel/ros2_object_msgs): ROS2 messages for object.
*  [ROS2 Object Analytics](https://github.com/intel/ros2_object_analytics): ROS2 package for object detection, tracking and 2D/3D localization.
*  [ROS2 Message Filters](https://github.com/intel/ros2_message_filters): ROS2 package for message synchronization with time stamp.
*  [ROS2 CV Bridge](https://github.com/ros-perception/vision_opencv/tree/ros2/cv_bridge): ROS2 package to bridge with openCV.
*  [ROS2 Object Map](https://github.com/intel/ros2_object_map): ROS2 package to mark tag of objects on map when SLAM based on information provided by ROS2 object analytics.
*  [ROS2 Moving Object](https://github.com/intel/ros2_moving_object): ROS2 package to provide object motion information (like object velocity on x, y, z axis) based on information provided by ROS2 object analytics.

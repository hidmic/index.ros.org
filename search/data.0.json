It transforms the Gazebo feedback to\n     the \"tactile_data\" topic to provide the same tactile sensor interface as\n     the schunk_sdh package.\n\n     The following parameters can be set:\n     * cells_x: The number of patches on the tactile sensor in the direction\n                perpendicular to the finger. Defaults to 6.\n     * cells_y: The number of patches on the tactile sensor along the direction\n                of the finger. Defaults to 14.\n     * output_range: The maximum output value of one patch. Defaults to 3500.\n     * sensitivity: The change of output in one patch per Newton. Defaults to\n                    350. The sensitivity can be approximated by the following\n                    formula: S = output_range / (measurement_range * cell_area)\n                    - The measurement range of the tactile pads is 250 kPa (from\n                      the data sheet).\n                    - The output range can be determined by experiment from the\n                      real SDH. It is about 3500.\n                    - The cell area is the size of one patch. Length and width\n                      of the area are determined by dividing the length/width\n                      of the collision surface by the number of cells in the\n                      respective direction.\n                      Important: In most cases this is NOT the cell area that is\n                                 given in the data sheet!\n     * filter_length: The length of the moving average filter which smoothes\n                      the values from simulation. Defaults to 10.\n\n     The node subscribes to the following topics to receive data from the\n     simulation:\n     * thumb_2/state\n     * thumb_3/state\n     * finger_12/state\n     * finger_13/state\n     * finger_22/state\n     * finger_23/state\n\n     The node publishes the processed data on the following topic:\n     * tactile_data\n\n     The simulated bumper must obtain the collision data in the link that the\n     sensor is attached to.

HLDS(Hitachi-LG Data Storage) is developing the technology for the moving platform sensor such as Robot Vacuum Cleaners, Home Robot, Robotics Lawn Mower Sensor, etc.\n  ","maintainers":"Pyo","authors":"Darby Lim Pyo JH Yang SP Kong","distro":"melodic","instance":"github-ROBOTIS-GIT-hls_lfcd_lds_driver","readme":""},{"id":12732,"baseurl":"","url":"/p/mrpt2/github-mrpt-mrpt#melodic","last_commit_time":"2018-10-04","tags":"mrpt2","name":"mrpt2","repo_name":"mrpt1","released":"","unreleased":"","version":"1.9.9","description":"Mobile Robot Programming Toolkit (MRPT) version 2.x","maintainers":"Jose-Luis Blanco-Claraco","authors":"Jose-Luis Blanco-Claraco","distro":"melodic","instance":"github-mrpt-mrpt","readme":""},{"id":12734,"baseurl":"","url":"/p/mrpt_bridge/github-mrpt-ros-pkg-mrpt_bridge#melodic","last_commit_time":"2018-07-11","tags":"mrpt bridge","name":"mrpt_bridge","repo_name":"mrpt_bridge","released":"is:released","unreleased":"is:unreleased","version":"0.1.25","description":"C++ library to convert between ROS messages and MRPT classes","maintainers":"Jose-Luis Blanco-Claraco","authors":"Markus Bader Raphael Zack","distro":"melodic","instance":"github-mrpt-ros-pkg-mrpt_bridge","readme":""},{"id":12736,"baseurl":"","url":"/p/mrpt_msgs/github-mrpt-ros-pkg-mrpt_msgs#melodic","last_commit_time":"2018-06-09","tags":"mrpt msgs","name":"mrpt_msgs","repo_name":"mrpt_msgs","released":"is:released","unreleased":"is:unreleased","version":"0.1.23","description":"ROS messages for MRPT classes and objects","maintainers":"Jose-Luis Blanco-Claraco Markus Bader","authors":"","distro":"melodic","instance":"github-mrpt-ros-pkg-mrpt_msgs","readme":""},{"id":12738,"baseurl":"","url":"/p/mrpt_generic_sensor/github-mrpt-ros-pkg-mrpt_sensors#melodic","last_commit_time":"2018-06-17","tags":"mrpt generic sensor","name":"mrpt_generic_sensor","repo_name":"mrpt_sensors","released":"","unreleased":"","version":"0.0.1","description":"ROS node for interfacing any sensor supported by mrpt-hwdrivers","maintainers":"Jose-Luis Blanco-Claraco","authors":"Jose-Luis Blanco-Claraco","distro":"melodic","instance":"github-mrpt-ros-pkg-mrpt_sensors","readme":""},{"id":12739,"baseurl":"","url":"/p/mrpt_sensorlib/github-mrpt-ros-pkg-mrpt_sensors#melodic","last_commit_time":"2018-06-17","tags":"mrpt sensorlib","name":"mrpt_sensorlib","repo_name":"mrpt_sensors","released":"","unreleased":"","version":"0.0.1","description":"C++ library for the base generic MRPT sensor node","maintainers":"Jose-Luis Blanco-Claraco","authors":"Jose-Luis Blanco-Claraco","distro":"melodic","instance":"github-mrpt-ros-pkg-mrpt_sensors","readme":""},{"id":12740,"baseurl":"","url":"/p/mrpt_sensors/github-mrpt-ros-pkg-mrpt_sensors#melodic","last_commit_time":"2018-06-17","tags":"mrpt sensors","name":"mrpt_sensors","repo_name":"mrpt_sensors","released":"","unreleased":"","version":"0.0.1","description":"\n    ROS nodes for various robotics sensors via mrpt-hwdrivers\n  ","maintainers":"Jose-Luis Blanco-Claraco","authors":"","distro":"melodic","instance":"github-mrpt-ros-pkg-mrpt_sensors","readme":""},{"id":12751,"baseurl":"","url":"/p/nerian_stereo/github-nerian-vision-nerian_stereo#melodic","last_commit_time":"2018-08-30","tags":"nerian stereo","name":"nerian_stereo","repo_name":"nerian_stereo","released":"is:released","unreleased":"is:unreleased","version":"3.0.2","description":"Driver node for SceneScan and SP1 stereo vision sensors by Nerian Vision Technologies","maintainers":"Konstantin Schauwecker","authors":"Nerian Vision Technologies","distro":"melodic","instance":"github-nerian-vision-nerian_stereo","readme":""},{"id":12780,"baseurl":"","url":"/p/pilz_extensions/github-PilzDE-pilz_industrial_motion#melodic","last_commit_time":"2018-09-27","tags":"pilz extensions","name":"pilz_extensions","repo_name":"pilz_industrial_motion","released":"is:released","unreleased":"is:unreleased","version":"0.1.1","description":"\n  The pilz_extensions package.

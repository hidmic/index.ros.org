The node subscribes to\n     the Gazebo bumper topics of the SDH. It transforms the Gazebo feedback to\n     the \"tactile_data\" topic to provide the same tactile sensor interface as\n     the schunk_sdh package.\n\n     The following parameters can be set:\n     * cells_x: The number of patches on the tactile sensor in the direction\n                perpendicular to the finger. Defaults to 6.\n     * cells_y: The number of patches on the tactile sensor along the direction\n                of the finger. Defaults to 14.\n     * output_range: The maximum output value of one patch. Defaults to 3500.\n     * sensitivity: The change of output in one patch per Newton. Defaults to\n                    350. The sensitivity can be approximated by the following\n                    formula: S = output_range / (measurement_range * cell_area)\n                    - The measurement range of the tactile pads is 250 kPa (from\n                      the data sheet).\n                    - The output range can be determined by experiment from the\n                      real SDH. It is about 3500.\n                    - The cell area is the size of one patch. Length and width\n                      of the area are determined by dividing the length/width\n                      of the collision surface by the number of cells in the\n                      respective direction.\n                      Important: In most cases this is NOT the cell area that is\n                                 given in the data sheet!\n     * filter_length: The length of the moving average filter which smoothes\n                      the values from simulation. Defaults to 10.\n\n     The node subscribes to the following topics to receive data from the\n     simulation:\n     * thumb_2/state\n     * thumb_3/state\n     * finger_12/state\n     * finger_13/state\n     * finger_22/state\n     * finger_23/state\n\n     The node publishes the processed data on the following topic:\n     * tactile_data\n\n     The simulated bumper must obtain the collision data in the link that the\n     sensor is attached to. This is achieved by setting the \"frameName\" property\n     in the gazebo_ros_bumper controller.","maintainers":"Bruno Brito","authors":"Sven Schneider","distro":"indigo","instance":"github-ipa320-schunk_modular_robotics","readme":""},{"id":6673,"baseurl":"","url":"/p/schunk_svh_driver/github-fzi-forschungszentrum-informatik-schunk_svh_driver#indigo","last_commit_time":"2017-12-14","tags":"schunk svh driver","name":"schunk_svh_driver","repo_name":"schunk_svh_driver","released":"is:released","unreleased":"is:unreleased","version":"0.2.0","description":"SVH Driver wrapper to enable control of the Schunk five finger hand","maintainers":"Georg Heppner","authors":"Georg Heppner","distro":"indigo","instance":"github-fzi-forschungszentrum-informatik-schunk_svh_driver","readme":""},{"id":6676,"baseurl":"","url":"/p/screenrun/github-dornhege-screenrun#indigo","last_commit_time":"2015-11-16","tags":"screenrun","name":"screenrun","repo_name":"screenrun","released":"is:released","unreleased":"is:unreleased","version":"1.0.2","description":"\n      screenrun is a small tool that pushes commands into a screen window.\n      Use \\015 after a command for ENTER, i.e. executing it.\n  ","maintainers":"Christian Dornhege","authors":"Christian Dornhege","distro":"indigo","instance":"github-dornhege-screenrun","readme":""},{"id":6699,"baseurl":"","url":"/p/segbot/github-utexas-bwi-segbot#indigo","last_commit_time":"2018-03-09","tags":"segbot","name":"segbot","repo_name":"segbot","released":"is:released","unreleased":"is:unreleased","version":"0.3.5","description":"\n    ROS packages for controlling Segway-based robots at the Learning Agents\n    Research Group (LARG), AI Laboratory, Department of Computer Science, \n    University of Texas at Austin.\n  ","maintainers":"Piyush Khandelwal Jack O'Quin","authors":"Piyush Khandelwal","distro":"indigo","instance":"github-utexas-bwi-segbot","readme":""},{"id":6700,"baseurl":"","url":"/p/segbot_bringup/github-utexas-bwi-segbot#indigo","last_commit_time":"2018-03-09","tags":"segbot bringup","name":"segbot_bringup","repo_name":"segbot","released":"is:released","unreleased":"is:unreleased","version":"0.3.5","description":"\n    Contains launch files and runtime scripts necessary for running\n    segbots in simulation and in the real world.\n  ","maintainers":"Piyush Khandelwal Jack O'Quin","authors":"Piyush Khandelwal","distro":"indigo","instance":"github-utexas-bwi-segbot","readme":""},{"id":6701,"baseurl":"","url":"/p/segbot_description/github-utexas-bwi-segbot#indigo","last_commit_time":"2018-03-09","tags":"segbot description","name":"segbot_description","repo_name":"segbot","released":"is:released","unreleased":"is:unreleased","version":"0.3.5","description":"\n    Contains URDF descriptions of all robot components and sensors for the\n    segbot, as well as all the different sensor configurations for a segbot.\n  ","maintainers":"Piyush Khandelwal Jack O'Quin","authors":"Piyush Khandelwal","distro":"indigo","instance":"github-utexas-bwi-segbot","readme":""},{"id":6702,"baseurl":"","url":"/p/segbot_firmware/github-utexas-bwi-segbot#indigo","last_commit_time":"2018-03-09","tags":"segbot firmware","name":"segbot_firmware","repo_name":"segbot","released":"is:released","unreleased":"is:unreleased","version":"0.3.5","description":"\n    Arduino firmware for BWI segbot sensor array.\n  ","maintainers":"Jack O'Quin Piyush Khandelwal","authors":"Jose Bigio Jack O'Quin Tim Eckel (NewPing library)","distro":"indigo","instance":"github-utexas-bwi-segbot","readme":""},{"id":6703,"baseurl":"","url":"/p/segbot_gazebo/github-utexas-bwi-segbot#indigo","last_commit_time":"2018-03-09","tags":"segbot gazebo","name":"segbot_gazebo","repo_name":"segbot","released":"is:released","unreleased":"is:unreleased","version":"0.3.5","description":"bwi_gazebo","maintainers":"Piyush Khandelwal Jack O'Quin","authors":"Piyush Khandelwal","distro":"indigo","instance":"github-utexas-bwi-segbot","readme":""},{"id":6704,"baseurl":"","url":"/p/segbot_gui/github-utexas-bwi-segbot#indigo","last_commit_time":"2018-03-09","tags":"segbot gui","name":"segbot_gui","repo_name":"segbot","released":"is:released","unreleased":"is:unreleased","version":"0.3.5","description":"\n    Displays a simple GUI to the user.

UWSim visualizes an underwater virtual scenario that can be configured using standard modeling software. Controllable underwater vehicles, surface vessels and robotic manipulators, as well as simulated sensors, can be added to the scene and accessed externally through ROS interfaces. This allows to easily integrate the visualization tool with existing control architectures.\n  ","maintainers":"Mario Prats Javier Perez","authors":"Mario Prats Javier Perez","distro":"indigo","instance":"github-uji-ros-pkg-underwater_simulation","readme":""},{"id":7222,"baseurl":"","url":"/p/unique_id/github-ros-geographic-info-unique_identifier#indigo","last_commit_time":"2018-01-23","tags":"unique id","name":"unique_id","repo_name":"unique_identifier","released":"is:released","unreleased":"is:unreleased","version":"1.0.6","description":"\n    ROS Python and C++ interfaces for universally unique identifiers.\n  ","maintainers":"Jack O'Quin","authors":"Jack O'Quin","distro":"indigo","instance":"github-ros-geographic-info-unique_identifier","readme":""},{"id":7223,"baseurl":"","url":"/p/unique_identifier/github-ros-geographic-info-unique_identifier#indigo","last_commit_time":"2018-01-23","tags":"unique identifier","name":"unique_identifier","repo_name":"unique_identifier","released":"is:released","unreleased":"is:unreleased","version":"1.0.6","description":"\n    ROS messages and interfaces for universally unique identifiers.\n\n    Not needed for wet packages, use only to resolve dry stack\n    dependencies.\n  ","maintainers":"Jack O'Quin","authors":"Jack O'Quin","distro":"indigo","instance":"github-ros-geographic-info-unique_identifier","readme":""},{"id":7224,"baseurl":"","url":"/p/uuid_msgs/github-ros-geographic-info-unique_identifier#indigo","last_commit_time":"2018-01-23","tags":"uuid msgs","name":"uuid_msgs","repo_name":"unique_identifier","released":"is:released","unreleased":"is:unreleased","version":"1.0.6","description":"\n    ROS messages for universally unique identifiers.\n  ","maintainers":"Jack O'Quin","authors":"Jack O'Quin","distro":"indigo","instance":"github-ros-geographic-info-unique_identifier","readme":""},{"id":7241,"baseurl":"","url":"/p/universal_robot/github-ros-industrial-universal_robot#indigo","last_commit_time":"2018-01-06","tags":"universal robot","name":"universal_robot","repo_name":"universal_robot","released":"is:released","unreleased":"is:unreleased","version":"1.1.11","description":"\n      Drivers, description, and utilities for Universal Robot Arms.\n  ","maintainers":"Felix Messmer G.A. vd.
